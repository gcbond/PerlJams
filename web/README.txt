This is a web interface for the sql database generated by PerlJams.
It will allow you to quickly search your library and even download the files.
This was designed to be run on a web sever.  The web sever must mount the music directory in some fashion
for downloading to work.  You may select multiple items to download which it will add to a ZIP file.

Generate the sql script and insert it into your databse.
Modify includes/config.php appropriately to work with your system.

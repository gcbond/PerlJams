This program will scan a given directory for music and extract the ID3 tags into an index.
The index can then be modified and eventually written to a new path.
The goal is to create a common structure for your music library
The structure is Artist/Album/1Track.MP3

The following packages are needed
Image::ExifTool
Lingua::EN::Numbers
Both are available on CPAN.

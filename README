This program will index a given directory for music files and extract the ID3 tags 
into an index that you can then sort and parse though.
The index can then be modified and eventually written to a new path.
The goal is to create a common structure for your music library
The structure is EX: Artist/Album/1 - Track.mp3
The files will be moved/copied from the old source to the new directory.
Check error.log for details on why files were not indexed.

The following packages should already be installed.
File::Find
File::Copy
File::Path
Cwd
Storable
Term::ANSIColor

These packages will also need to be installed and are available on CPAN.
Image::ExifTool       (http://search.cpan.org/dist/Image-ExifTool/)
Lingua::EN::Numbers   (http://search.cpan.org/~neilb/Lingua-EN-Numbers-1.03/)
